# Contribution Guidelines

When making a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

* One commit per suggestion is preferred
* Commit message should follow this format: `Add some tool name` \(For

  example, `Add cuckoo-sandbox`\) [Why?](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

* Multiple commits per pull request is OK
* Lists within each section are alphabetized, please keep them that way
* Add sections if necessary, use existing sections if possible
* Clear, concise descriptions for each link, starting with a capital, ending

  with a period

* Use the following format: `[Item Name](homepage link) - Description.`
* No duplication of tools, put them where they make the most sense
* Wrap lines at ~80 chars, no trailing whitespace or unnecessary newlines
* Prefer quality over quantity, only submit awesome stuff
* By submitting a pull request, you agree to release your submission under

  the [LICENSE](https://github.com/Gitludo/awesome-malware-analysis/tree/8dd52400427cab9cb7fd34e7c5567ea9d8b2dad6/LICENSE/README.md)

* Indent wrapped lines even with the start of the line before

```text
- That means lines wrap like
  this
- Not
like this
```

The rules above take precedence, but in case I missed something, check [the awesome guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md) too.

Properly formatted pull requests will almost always be approved faster than issues or poorly formatted pull requests, because they mean less work for me!

Thanks!
